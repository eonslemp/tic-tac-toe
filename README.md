# Crosses and Naughts: A Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe 

### This project is an implementation of tic-tac-tow in javascript.  This is my first full project with HTML, css, and Javasciript.  I found this project to be more challenging than I had initially anticipated.  Luckily there are a ton of great resources on how do a similiar project should you get stuck.  Below is a list of several such resources that I found useful.

## Some Features of This Project
### I wanted this implementation to be as fun and accessible as possible.  It is simple to restart and select an opponent.  The player can play with another person by selecting 'play as naughts' button and alternating control of the mouse between the players.  There is also a weak ai the player can play against by clicking on the SpongeBob image.  It was my intent to include an unbeatable ai that a player could choose by clicking the 'skyNET' image, but this feature is complete at this time.  Some further improvements I intend to make are a refactor of the code for improved modularity and an addition of some hover effects on the ai player icons. The working [site](https://eonslemp.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) is hosted on github pages.
